# Flight Reservation System Using C++


## Introduction
Unlike olden days where we have to go to airline booking office or
airport to book a flight to our desired destinations, we can now book
a flight ticket whenever and wherever we need via internet and SKY
HIGH gives you the platform to exactly do this.
In this program a person who is desiring to use this application needs
to register as a user with a definite password and username. We
ensure that no data of yours would be leaked. Skyhigh has a foolproof
password system which is considered to be one of the best in this
business.
With this program, we help you to book your flight tickets of our
partner airline and fly wherever you like (if your desired airline has
a service to that place). You can even select the food to be served and
customise the how much baggage you desire to take
With attracting offers offered by the airlines and us for all the users,
and special benefits for gold and platinum members, which anybody
can become by just using our portal more and more, you can book
your ticket at the most affordable rate in the world. We also provide
the customer the freesom to cancel the booking free of cost, which no
other flight reservation platform would provide and thereby
reducing the tension for the customer.
We also provide a platform to pay for your flight ticket with our
WALLET app SKY PAY, With each new user geting a bonus of Rs 1000
from us and on top of that, your wallet balance will increase with each
transaction or can be increased via transaction with any of your
desired bank.
All in all, SKY HIGH is a reliable and easy to use flight reservation
system, which gives you a heavenly experience when it comes to
flight reservation.
